## Future Work

We have exciting plans to enhance SkyVoyage and provide an even better user experience. Here are some features and improvements we plan to implement in the future:

Integrate with a reliable flight data API to fetch real-time information about flight schedules, availability, and pricing. This will ensure users get the most up-to-date flight options.

Flight Dates and Seat Selection: 
Enhance the booking process by allowing users to select specific travel dates and preferred seats. This will provide users with more flexibility and personalization options.

Email Confirmation: 
Implement an automated email confirmation system that sends a booking confirmation to users once they successfully book a flight. This will help users stay informed about their travel plans.

Payment Gateway Integration: 
Integrate a secure payment gateway to facilitate online payments for flight bookings. This will streamline the booking process and provide a seamless experience for users.

User Profiles and Preferences: 
Create user profiles that store travel preferences and previous bookings. This will allow users to access their booking history and receive personalized flight recommendations.

Multi-language Support: 
Add support for multiple languages to make SkyVoyage accessible to a broader audience.

Flight Reviews and Ratings: 
Implement a feature that allows users to leave reviews and ratings for flights they have taken. This will help other users make informed decisions while booking.
